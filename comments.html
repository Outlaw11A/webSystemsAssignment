					<h3>Technical Aspects</h3>
					
					<h4>Structure</h4>
					
					<p>
						<span>
							I have structured the website in a simplistic way that aims to lower any confusion that someone may have when viewing the website. 
							This has been done by using the same structure for each page of the website, but also by placing items that may be used more often than others in places that are easy to locate. 
							The menu location is an example of placing elements in an easily accessible location.
							It is located at the top of the page and can be found in the same location on all pages.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						The title of the page is located at the top of every page as this is the logical location for it.
					</p>
					
					<h4>CSS Classes &amp; IDs</h4>
					
					<p>
						I have used the following CSS Classes and IDs to format the look of the website.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<code>.container</code> Controls the styling of all of the content on the page. 
						I have used it to position the content in the middle of the page.
					</p>

					<p>
						<code>.menu</code> This class is the container for the menu buttons and essentially creates a aesthetically pleasing background for the menu buttons.
					</p>					
					
					<p>
						<code>.menubutton</code> This class aims to style the individual menu buttons that are located at the top of the page within the <code>.menu</code> class.
					</p>

					<p>
						<code>.contentcontainer</code> Just like the <code>.menu</code> class, this class styles the background elements for the content part of the page.
						It creates a background for the content and makes the text stand out from the background.
					</p>

					<p>
						<code>.content</code> This styles the actual content or main section of information on the page.
					</p>

					<p>
						<code>.unit</code> This class aligns any units to the right.
					</p>

					<p>
						<code>#title</code> This ID has been used to style the title that is located at the top of every page.
						As there is only one title on every page, an ID is appropriate in this situation.
					</p>									
					
					<h3>Aesthetic Aspects</h3>
					
					<p>
						To make the website appealing to the users of the website, I have intergrated various elements to do this.
						A good looking website will ensure that users stay on it but users can also judge the quality of a business or person based on their website.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						With this in mind, I have done the following to ensure that the website is aesthetically pleasing.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Colour Scheme.</b> I have used a colour scheme that complements itself.
						The darker colours are also not as harsh on the eyes.
						I have also included an aqua colour in certain elements of the website to make elements both stand out but to add interest to the website.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<b>Rounded Corners.</b> I have chosen to round the corners on all box like elements on the page to add interest to the page, but also to break the sharp lines of the chosen font. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>Sans Serif Font.</b> As well as being easier to read than a Serif font, I have chose Helvetica, a Sans Serif font as the font for the website because it conveys a modern look that I am attempting to achieve with this website.  
					</p>					
					
					<h3>Accessibility</h3>
					<p>
						To make the website usable for users that have disabilities, I have implemented an array of features. 
						Disabled users are not able to view or use the website like a normal person would, therefore extra provisions have to be taken to ensure that they can use the website correctly.
					</p>
					<p>
						The website, <a href="http://webaim.org/intro/">webaim.org</a>, lists the following as the major categories of disability types:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>“Visual: Blindness, low vision, color-blindness”</li>
						<li>“Hearing: Deafness and hard-of-hearing”</li>
						<li>“Motor: Inability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited fine motor control”</li>
						<li>“Cognitive: Learning disabilities, distractibility, inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information”</li>
					</ul>
										
					<p>
						I have implemented the following to make the website usable for users that have disabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Not relying on colour to convey meaning.</b> Relying too much on colour to convey information or meaning may be prohibiting for users that have a colour blindness disability.
						I have used a colour palette that does not have conflicting colours that will make it hard for colour blind users to read information.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Providing alternate text for non-text content.</b> By providing alternate text for content that is not text, it enables users that use readers to view web pages to know what the non-text content was.
						This would be applicable if someone was blind or had limited sight.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Providing headers for table columns.</b> This allows users that use readers to get an understanding on what the table is aiming to convey.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Designing the website to standards.</b> By designing the website to standards, it means it will be compatible with the any readers or tools that a disabled user may use to view the website.
						Designing a website to standards is a good practice as it ensures the website is compatible across different platforms and browsers. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Breaking text up.</b> By using headers to separate large sections of text it ensures that the text is readible.
						Users with disabilities that make them easily distracted or inability to focus on large amounts of information will find this feature beneficial.
