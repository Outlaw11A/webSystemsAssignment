					<h2>Past</h2>
					
					<p>
						<span>
							I attended Barker College, located on the north shore for the majority of my schooling.
							I started going there in Year 3 in 2004, all the way up to Year 12 in 2013.
						</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						I completed the following subjects in Year 12 for my HSC:

					<p>
						Doing Software Design and Development in Year 10 got me really passionate for programming and computing in general. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I have worked casually in the Barker College IT Department, doing various tasks as an assistant IT technician.
						One of the larger roles I have had to do was setting up and deploying roughly 300 iPads to primary school children.
						This required a large amount of steps and processes to ensure that they were set up properly.
					</p>

					<p>
						In my downtime I enjoy programming and playing video games.
						I am passionate for skiing as well, the following image was taken of me last year in Colorado.
