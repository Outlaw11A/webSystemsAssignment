					<h2>Future</h2>

					<p>
						<span>
							As well as being interested in Programming, I interested in networking.
							I will be undertaking the networking major.
						</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						I hope to use my skills to further improve the Internet and make it a safer, more open place for everyone globally to use.
						Working in environments with large amounts of hardware and big data has been an ultimate goal of mine, and having a positive impact on the internet would be tremondous.
					</p>

					<p>
						Ensuring that the Internet stays unrestricted, free and open for everyone is also another vision that I hold.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am also a big fan of open source software, and with the recent HeartBleed bug, am very interested in the combination of security software and open source.
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, I am concerned with the availability of high speed internet services to resedential properties. 
						I would like the internet to not be determined by a government body, and stay free and unrestricted.
